This is an attempt to present my thoughts and opinions on a range of topics to a wider audience. I'm interested in philosophy, improving society, and exploring how I can attempt to make a difference in the world, and potentially also an outlet to talk about the things I enjoy and why I enjoy them, to perhaps give others a feeling of appreciation for things they haven't appreciated before, or see things in a new light. Would love any feedback.
